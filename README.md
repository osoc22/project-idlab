# Project IDLab - Powerful Personal Data

## Getting started

Prerequisites:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (In case you're using Windows, make sure to tick `install Git Bash`, so you can use run.sh!)

## Demo/test/dev credentials
These credentials will be set when either saying yes to the dev-setup dialogue on install,
or when running `./setup.sh dev`.

name: johndoe
email: johndoe@test.edu
password: johndoe

## Production
It should be noted that in run.sh, the file-no-setup config is used.
For production, there's probably better options! Check out the available configs [here](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer/tree/main/config).
