# Second meeting with client

## Meeting overview
- Ben liked our progress so far and was ok with us continuing with the calendar application demo.
- He thinks the functionality of the calendar is good, but the more open data (points of interest, reviews) and personal data (location history, friends data) will make the demo cooler. The whole goal of the demo is to showcase how cool and useful linked data is. And how you can use linked data (IDLab) libraries to build apps.
- As for showcasing the power of linked data, he agreed that allowing the addition of extra data sources with no extra integration steps showcases well the magic of RDF.
- We can contact him throughout the week if we have any additional questions or issues with RDF data or RML conversions.
- By the end of the week he will message us with more information related to any open weather APIs that we can use (if they exist). Moreover, he will also link us some inspirational materials about linked data and why it is a nice concept.
- He will send us some other proof of concepts that make usage of Solid and/or linked data such as knoodle which allows you to take note using RDF. 

## Goals until the end of the week

- Link the frontend with the Solid pod and use Comunica to query data from RDF files.
- Deploy our demo online and have people test it.
