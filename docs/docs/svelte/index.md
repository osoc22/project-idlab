# Svelte/front-end docs

The web interface is the client-side application that connects to the backend and Solid server. The tasks of the frontend can be compressed into the following points:
- Show the interactable calendar interface to the user: see the [structure.md](structure) docs.
- Read data from & write data to the solid pod (thus also allowing the user to log into their pod/grant permissions): see the [solid-integration docs](solid-integration).
- Grab the data from external API (weather) and integrate it with the calendar events stored in the pod: see the [backend](../backend) docs.
