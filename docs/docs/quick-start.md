# Quick start

This project is a calendar app that uses linked data for weather info on your own calendar, all stored in your personal solid pod.

## Get a pod

Solid pods are moveable, privacy-focused, decentralised data stores.
See the [solid project website](https://solidproject.org/about) for more info on that.

Before you can use this application, you'll need a Solid pod by either...
- ... using your existing pod (if applicable).
- ... [signing up for a pod](https://solidproject.org/users/get-a-pod) from a pod provider.
