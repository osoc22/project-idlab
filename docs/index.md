Team Powerful Personal Data, also known as Solid Concepts, partnered up with [IDLab](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en) and [Imec](https://www.imec-int.com/en) to showcase how "taking back control of your personal data" can be achieved using linked data and Solid pods. We have built a smart calendar application that takes advantage of linked data to serve you weather data for the events that you store on your private Solid pod.
